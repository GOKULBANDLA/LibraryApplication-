Widely accepted as the authoritative text and reference on electronic circuit design, both analog and digital, this book revolutionized the teaching of electronics by emphasizing the methods actually used by circuit designers -- a combination of some basic laws, rules of thumb, and a large bag of tricks. The result is a largely nonmathematical treatment that encourages circuit intuition, brainstorming, and simplified calculations of circuit values and performance. The new Art of Electronics retains the feeling of informality and easy access that helped make the first edition so successful and popular. It is an ideal first textbook on electronics for scientists and engineers and an indispensable reference for anyone, professional or amateur, who works with electronic circuits.",

      "description": "Stephen Cecchetti’s new text on Money and Banking offers a fresh, more modern, and more student-friendly approach to the subject. The author has drawn on his vast experience as Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, publishing in and editing various journals, and consulting for the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Israel, and the Reserve Bank of Australia as well as his years of teaching at various schools including Ohio State, Brandeis, Princeton, and Oxford University. Students will find the material more relevant and interesting because of the book’s unique emphasis on the Five Core Principles, the early introduction of risk, and an integrated global perspective. Cecchetti is THE money and banking book for today’s students; by focusing on the big picture via core principles, Cecchetti teaches students the rationale for financial rules and institutional structure so that even when the financial system evolves, students’ knowledge will not be out of date."

A highlight of the art program are the micro-to-macro art pieces helping students to conceptually understand organic chemistry.
